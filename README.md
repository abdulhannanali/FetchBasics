# FetchBasics

FetchBasics lets people read articles from all over the internet when using 
Facebook's FreeBasics Services. 

### Note
I am not working on this program anymore, as Facebook has horrible limits on everything and this 
can lead to my own Facebook account being banned. Many articles on the web are long and can easily take
from 5000 to 15000+ characters, however, Messenger has a 640 character limit and dividing the message into
many chunks will be a very bad UX.
